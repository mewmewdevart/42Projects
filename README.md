	42CURSUS

<p align="center">
	<b><i>Projects developed at <a href="https://www.42sp.org.br/">42 S√£o Paulo</a>, a programming school.</i></b><br>
	Start date: 05/september/2022 - Currently
</p>

> 42 Ecole (also known simply as "42") is a French programming school that was founded in 2013. The school does not charge tuition fees and offers a project-based learning program, where students learn programming through practical projects rather than traditional classes. The school is renowned for its unconventional approach to education, which focuses on collaboration, problem-solving, and self-directed learning. <br><br>
This repository is a compilation of projects that I have developed during my time at 42 Sao Paulo. Here, you will discover a diverse compilation of projects from the school's common-curriculum. <br><br>

<br>
The 42 cursus is free for individuals who are accepted through its rigorous selection process, known as the "Piscine." These successful candidates become cadets (students) of 42. <br>
For more detailed information about the selection process, commonly referred to as the "Piscine," please visit the [C Piscine and Shell Repository](https://github.com/mewmewdevart/42SP_Piscina). üèäüèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
  
## üìÅ Projects

### Level_00/**[peer2peer ](p2p_101)**
  √âvaluations: How to use non-violent communication, and how to know how to behave in the face of different scenarios during peer2peer. <br>
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Keywords: `Communication` `42Method` 

### Level_00/**[piscine-reloaded ](piscine_reloaded)**
  It contains a best-of of the exercises we did during the Piscine C to remind us all the basics of the C programming language.<br>

 Entrando em Orbita
</h2> 
I successfully completed the first phase (out of three) of the Common Core at 42 S√£o Paulo. <br> This phase provided me with the opportunity to undertake six challenging projects; Libft, GNL, Ft_printf, Born2BeRoot, So_long and Pipex. <br> <br>


### Project_01/**[Libft](https://github.com/mewmewdevart/libft)** üìö
This project involved creating my own personal static library of functions. It is a collection of functions that imitate the behavior of traditional functions such as ```strlen```, ```strcpy```, and more. The challenge of the project was to create functions that replicate the same functionality as these original functions using restricted functions like ```write``` and ```malloc```. <br>
Developing the Libft made me understand string manipulation, dynamic memory allocation, the usage of Makefile for compilation, and gain familiarity with fundamental concepts related to static libraries in C. <br>
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Keywords: `Static Library` , `Makefile`, `Functions`, `String Manipulation`, `Memory Allocation`

### Project_02/**[Get Next Line (GNL)](https://github.com/mewmewdevart/get_next_line)**  üìÉ
The GNL project focused on reading content from a file descriptor line by line, honing my file handling skills and improving my understanding of input/output operations in C. <br>
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Keywords: `File descriptor`, `Static variables`, `File Reading`, `Input/Output`

### Project_03/**[ft_printf](https://github.com/mewmewdevart/ft_printf)** üñ®Ô∏è
In this project, I developed my own version of the printf function. It required a deep understanding of formatting and printing data in different formats, enhancing my knowledge of this fundamental function.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Keywords: : `Formatting`, `Printing`, `Variadic Arguments`, `Format Specifiers`

### Project_04/**[born2reboot](https://github.com/mewmewdevart/born2beroot)** üíª
This captivating project involved configuring and customizing my own operating system on a virtual machine. It delved into low-level systems programming and offered hands-on experience with system configuration and management in the üêß system. <br>
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Keywords: `Operating System`, `Virtual Machine`, `Configuration`, `System Management`

### Project_05/**[so_long](https://github.com/mewmewdevart/so_long)** üéÆ
With the So_Long project, I designed and implemented my own 2D game. This allowed me to explore game development concepts, graphics rendering, and interactive gameplay mechanics. <br>
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Keywords: `2D Game`, `Graphics Rendering`, `Interactive Gameplay`, `Game Development`

### Project_06/**[pipex](https://github.com/mewmewdevart/pipex)**  ‚ÜîÔ∏èüìù
Pipex involved creating a program that simulated the functionality of Unix pipelines, executing multiple commands in sequence. It provided valuable experience in process management, interprocess communication, and command execution. <br>
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Keywords: `Unix Pipelines`, `Command Execution`, `Process Management`, `Interprocess Communication`
