	42CURSUS
</h1>

<p align="center">
	<b><i>Projects developed at <a href="https://www.42sp.org.br/">42 São Paulo</a>, a programming school.</i></b><br>
	Start date: 05/september/2022 - Currently
</p>

> 42 Ecole (also known simply as "42") is a French programming school founded in 2013. The school does not charge tuition fees and offers a project-based learning program, in which students learn programming through practical projects instead of traditional classes. The school is also known for its unconventional approach to education, which emphasizes collaboration, problem-solving, and self-directed learning. <br><br>
This repository is a collection of projects developed by me at 42 Sao Paulo. Here, you will find a variety of projects from the school's curriculum, ranging from basic programming exercises to complex and innovative software applications. <br><br>

The 42 cursus is free for whoever is approved in its selection process* - the so-called "Piscine" - becoming thus "cadets" (42's students). <br>
👉 For more information about 42's **selection process** (the "Piscine"), please visit the [C Piscine and Shell repo](https://github.com/mewmewdevart/42SP_Piscina). 🏊🏿‍♀️
  
## 📁 Projects

└── Keywords: `Communication` `42Method` 

### Level 0 : **[piscine-reloaded ](piscine_reloaded)**
  It contains a best-of of the exercises we did during the Piscine C to remind us all the basics of the C programming language.<br>

### Level 1 : **[libft](https://github.com/mewmewdevart/libft)**
  Build your own basic C static library, which will be used throughout the rest of the program. The ```ft_*``` functions mostly mimic the behaviour of the traditional C functions, and must be written using at most ```write()``` and ```malloc()```. <br>
└── Keywords: `Library` `Makefile`

### Level 2 : **[get_next_line](https://github.com/mewmewdevart/get_next_line)**
  Read from a file descriptor and deliver one line, that is, a ```\n```-terminated string of chars. <br>
└── Keywords: `File descriptor` `Static variables`

---
<a href="https://github.com/mewmewdevart/ft_printf" target="_blank"> <img align="center" alt="FT_PRINTF"  width="125" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50052600/202605092-3f63565e-f8d0-489c-a429-aff50873fe52.png"> </a>

### Level 3 : **[ft_printf](https://github.com/mewmewdevart/ft_printf)**
  Recode the standard C library function, printf(). <br>
└── Keywords: `Variadic arguments` `Library` `Makefile`

---
<a href="https://github.com/mewmewdevart/born2beroot" target="_blank"> <img align="center" alt="FT_PRINTF"  width="125" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50052600/211400216-8d671f57-fa33-4833-a764-11ec0f948274.png"> </a>

### Level 4 : **[born2reboot](https://github.com/mewmewdevart/born2beroot)**
This project aims to introduce you to the wonderful world of virtualization. <br>
└── Keywords: `Network & system administration`
