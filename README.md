	42CURSUS
</h1>

<p align="center">
	<b><i>Projects developed at <a href="https://www.42sp.org.br/">42 São Paulo</a>, a programming school.</i></b><br>
	Start date: September 5, 2022 – January 1, 2024. (To be continue).
</p>

> **42 École**, often simply called "**42**," is a French programming school founded in 2013. It stands out for its tuition-free, **project-based learning** program. Instead of traditional classes, students learn programming through hands-on projects, fostering **collaboration**, **problem-solving**, and **self-directed learning**. <br>
This repository showcases the diverse projects I've developed during my time at 42 São Paulo, specifically those from the school's **common curriculum**. <br>
Admission to 42's cursus is free for individuals who successfully complete its rigorous selection process, known as the "**Piscine**." Those who pass become **cadets** (students) of 42. <br>
For more detailed information about the selection process, often referred to as the "Piscine," please visit the **[C Piscine and Shell Repository](https://github.com/mewmewdevart/42SP_Piscina)**. 🏊🏿‍♀️

## 📁 Projects

 Entering Orbit/
</h2> 

<p align="center">
I successfully completed the first of three phases of the Common Core at 42 São Paulo. This phase provided me with the opportunity to undertake six challenging projects: Libft, GNL, Ft\_printf, Born2BeRoot, So\_long, and Pipex.
</p>

### Project_01/**[Libft](https://github.com/mewmewdevart/libft)** 📚
This project involved creating my own personal static library of functions. It is a collection of functions that imitate the behavior of traditional functions such as `strlen`, `strcpy`, and more. The challenge of the project was to create functions that replicate the same functionality as these original functions using restricted functions like `write` and `malloc`.   <br>
Developing Libft helped me understand string manipulation, dynamic memory allocation, the usage of Makefiles for compilation, and gain familiarity with fundamental concepts related to static libraries in C.   <br>
└── Keywords: `Static Library` , `Makefile`, `Functions`, `String Manipulation`, `Memory Allocation`

### Project\_02/**[Get Next Line (GNL)](https://github.com/mewmewdevart/get_next_line)**  📃

The GNL project focused on reading content from a file descriptor line by line, honing my file handling skills and improving my understanding of input/output operations in C.   <br>
└── Keywords: `File descriptor`, `Static variables`, `File Reading`, `Input/Output`

### Project\_03/**[Ft\_printf](https://github.com/mewmewdevart/ft_printf)** 🖨️

In this project, I developed my own version of the `printf` function. It required a deep understanding of formatting and printing data in different formats, enhancing my knowledge of this fundamental function.   <br>
└── Keywords: `Formatting`, `Printing`, `Variadic Arguments`, `Format Specifiers`

### Project\_04/**[Born2beboot](https://github.com/mewmewdevart/born2beroot)** 💻

This captivating project involved configuring and customizing my own operating system on a virtual machine. It delved into low-level systems programming and offered hands-on experience with system configuration and management in the 🐧 system.   <br>
└── Keywords: `Operating System`, `Virtual Machine`, `Configuration`, `System Management`

### Project\_05/**[So\_long](https://github.com/mewmewdevart/so_long)** 🎮

With the So\_Long project, I designed and implemented my own 2D game. This allowed me to explore game development concepts, graphics rendering, and interactive gameplay mechanics.   <br>
└── Keywords: `2D Game`, `Graphics Rendering`, `Interactive Gameplay`, `Game Development`

### Project\_06/**[Pipex](https://github.com/mewmewdevart/pipex)**  ↔️📝

Pipex involved creating a program that simulated the functionality of Unix pipelines, executing multiple commands in sequence. It provided valuable experience in process management, interprocess communication, and command execution.   <br>
└── Keywords: `Unix Pipelines`, `Command Execution`, `Process Management`, `Interprocess Communication`
