	<b><i>Projects developed at <a href="https://www.42sp.org.br/">42 S√£o Paulo</a> programming school.</i></b><br>
	Start date: 05/september/2022 - Currently

> _42 is a global education initiative that offers a new way of learning technology: no teachers, no classrooms, students learning from their fellow students (peer to peer learning), with a methodology that develops both computing and life skills. The 42 cursus is free for whoever is approved in its selection process* - the so-called "Piscine" - becoming thus "cadets" (42's students).

  \* For further information about 42's **selection process** (the "Piscine"), please visit the [C Piscine and Shell repo](https://github.com/mewmewdevart/42SP_Piscina). üèäüèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
  
  ## üìÅ Projects
### Level 1 - **[libft](https://github.com/mewmewdevart/libft)**
  Build your own basic C static library, which will be used throughout the rest of the program. The ```ft_*``` functions mostly mimic the behaviour of the traditional C functions, and must be written using at most ```write()``` and ```malloc()```.

### Level 2 - **[get_next_line](https://github.com/mewmewdevart/get_next_line)**
  Read from a file descriptor and deliver one line, that is, a ```\n```-terminated string of chars.

### Level 3 - **[ft_printf](https://github.com/mewmewdevart/ft_printf)**
  Recode the standard C library function, printf().
