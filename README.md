	42CURSUS

<p align="center">
	<b><i>Projects developed at <a href="https://www.42sp.org.br/">42 S√£o Paulo</a>, a programming school.</i></b><br>
	Start date: 05/september/2022 - Currently
</p>

> 42 Ecole (also known simply as "42") is a French programming school founded in 2013. The school does not charge tuition fees and offers a project-based learning program, in which students learn programming through practical projects instead of traditional classes. The school is also known for its unconventional approach to education, which emphasizes collaboration, problem-solving, and self-directed learning. <br><br>
This repository is a collection of projects developed by me at 42 Sao Paulo. Here, you will find a variety of projects from the school's curriculum, ranging from basic programming exercises to complex and innovative software applications. <br><br>

The 42 cursus is free for whoever is approved in its selection process* - the so-called "Piscine" - becoming thus "cadets" (42's students). <br>
üëâ For more information about 42's **selection process** (the "Piscine"), please visit the [C Piscine and Shell repo](https://github.com/mewmewdevart/42SP_Piscina). üèäüèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
  
## üìÅ Projects

### Level -1 : **[peer2peer ](p2p_101)**
  √âvaluations: How to use non-violent communication, and how to know how to behave in the face of different scenarios during peer2peer. <br>
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Keywords: `Communication` `42Method` 

### Level 0 : **[piscine-reloaded ](piscine_reloaded)**
  It contains a best-of of the exercises we did during the Piscine C to remind us all the basics of the C programming language.<br>
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Keywords: `C` `Shell` 

### Level 1 : **[libft](https://github.com/mewmewdevart/libft)**
  Build your own basic C static library, which will be used throughout the rest of the program. The ```ft_*``` functions mostly mimic the behaviour of the traditional C functions, and must be written using at most ```write()``` and ```malloc()```. <br>
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Keywords: `Library` `Makefile`

### Level 2 : **[get_next_line](https://github.com/mewmewdevart/get_next_line)**
  Read from a file descriptor and deliver one line, that is, a ```\n```-terminated string of chars. <br>
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Keywords: `File descriptor` `Static variables`

### Level 3 : **[ft_printf](https://github.com/mewmewdevart/ft_printf)**
  Recode the standard C library function, printf(). <br>
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Keywords: `Variadic arguments` `Library` `Makefile`

### Level 4 : **[born2reboot](https://github.com/mewmewdevart/born2beroot)**
This project aims to introduce you to the wonderful world of virtualization. <br>
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Keywords: `Network & system administration` 

### Level 5 : **[so_long](https://github.com/mewmewdevart/so_long)**
This project is a very small 2D game. Its purpose is to make you work with textures, sprites,
and some other very basic gameplay elements <br>
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Keywords: `Imperative programming`  `Graphics`

### Level 6 : **[pipex](https://github.com/mewmewdevart/pipex)**
A project that teaches inter-process communication using pipes by recreating shell pipelines. <br>
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Keywords: `Unix`  `C`
