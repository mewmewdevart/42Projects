	42CURSUS

<p align="center">
	<b><i>Projects developed at <a href="https://www.42sp.org.br/">42 S√£o Paulo</a> programming school.</i></b><br>
	Start date: 05/september/2022 - Currently
</p>

> _42 is a global education initiative that offers a new way of learning technology: no teachers, no classrooms, students learning from their fellow students (peer to peer learning), with a methodology that develops both computing and life skills. The 42 cursus is free for whoever is approved in its selection process* - the so-called "Piscine" - becoming thus "cadets" (42's students).

  \* For further information about 42's **selection process** (the "Piscine"), please visit the [C Piscine and Shell repo](https://github.com/mewmewdevart/42SP_Piscina). üèäüèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
  
## üìÅ Projects

### Level -1 : **[peer2peer ](p2p_101)**
  √âvaluations: How to use non-violent communication, and how to know how to behave in the face of different scenarios during peer2peer. <br>
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Keywords: `Communication` `42Method` 

### Level 0 : **[piscine-reloaded ](piscine_reloaded)**
  It contains a best-of of the exercises we did during the Piscine C to remind us all the basics of the C programming language.<br>
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Keywords: `C` `Shell` 

### Level 1 : **[libft](https://github.com/mewmewdevart/libft)**
  Build your own basic C static library, which will be used throughout the rest of the program. The ```ft_*``` functions mostly mimic the behaviour of the traditional C functions, and must be written using at most ```write()``` and ```malloc()```. <br>
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Keywords: `Library` `Makefile`

### Level 2 : **[get_next_line](https://github.com/mewmewdevart/get_next_line)**
  Read from a file descriptor and deliver one line, that is, a ```\n```-terminated string of chars. <br>
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Keywords: `File descriptor` `Static variables`

### Level 3 : **[ft_printf](https://github.com/mewmewdevart/ft_printf)**
  Recode the standard C library function, printf(). <br>
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Keywords: `Variadic arguments` `Library` `Makefile`

### Level 4 : **[born2reboot](https://github.com/mewmewdevart/born2beroot)**
This project aims to introduce you to the wonderful world of virtualization. <br>
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Keywords: `Network & system administration` 

### Level 5 : **[so_long](https://github.com/mewmewdevart/so_long)**
This project is a very small 2D game. Its purpose is to make you work with textures, sprites,
and some other very basic gameplay elements <br>
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Keywords: `Imperative programming`  `Graphics`
