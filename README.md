	42CURSUS

<p align="center">
	<b><i>Projects developed at <a href="https://www.42sp.org.br/">42 S√£o Paulo</a> programming school.</i></b><br>
	Start date: 05/september/2022 - Currently
</p>

> _42 is a global education initiative that offers a new way of learning technology: no teachers, no classrooms, students learning from their fellow students (peer to peer learning), with a methodology that develops both computing and life skills. The 42 cursus is free for whoever is approved in its selection process* - the so-called "Piscine" - becoming thus "cadets" (42's students).

  \* For further information about 42's **selection process** (the "Piscine"), please visit the [C Piscine and Shell repo](https://github.com/mewmewdevart/42SP_Piscina). üèäüèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
